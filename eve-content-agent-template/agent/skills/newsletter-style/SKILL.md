# Newsletter voice & style

When writing or editing a newsletter:

- Write to one person, not a list. "You", not "everyone".
- Subject line earns the open: specific and honest, never clickbait. Under ~50 chars, and
  front-load the point — mobile inboxes cut off around 33–43 characters.
- Set the preheader on purpose: extend the subject line, don't repeat it. Leave it blank and the
  client grabs the first stray text it finds.
- Open in the first sentence — no "Welcome back to another edition of…".
- One main thing per issue. Curated links can follow, but the issue has a spine.
- Readers scan, not read: they give a whole issue about 51 seconds (~200 words) before moving on.
  Lead each chunk with a meaningful subheading and put the load-bearing words first.
- Conversational but tight. Read it aloud; cut what you'd never say.
- Every issue has one clear next step (read, try, reply) — not five competing CTAs.
- No "in this edition we'll cover" preambles; just start.

## Structure

1. Subject line — the promise, specific and true.
2. Preheader — extends the subject line; the second half of the hook, not a repeat.
3. Open — the one idea, in the first two sentences.
4. Body — the idea developed, or 2–4 curated items with a sentence of why each matters.
   Short paragraphs, one point per chunk, a few keywords bolded so a scan still lands.
5. Close — the single next step, and a human sign-off.
